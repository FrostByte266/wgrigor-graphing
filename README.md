# Qt C++ Graphing Program
Welcome to the my GitHub repository. Let me give you a quick run through of this repository and my project.
This project was meant to create applications capable of graphing linear, quadratic, and exponential functions. This was made possible by two key libraries:
First, Qt: This is a C++ library for creating graphical programs.
Next, QCustomPlot: This is a library for Qt that allows you to create graphs in your application.

## Navigating the repository
In the root folder, you will find four folders. They contain the code for the programs, and one of them contains the 64 bit Windows
builds of the three programs. If you are here to review my work, what you are most likely looking for are located within either
"CustomPlot" (Linear equations), "ExponentalGraph" (Exponential equations), or "QuadraticGraph" (Quadratic equations). Within either of
those folders, you will find the source files. Note: I did not create and files with the name "qcustomplot" (source or header). Those are part
of the QCustomPlot library, and are included there in order to compile the program. The code that I wrote is mainly located in the file 
called: "mainwindow.cpp".
